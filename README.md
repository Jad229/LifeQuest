# LifeQuest: Become Your Best Self

### Gamified Habit Tracker

# What is LifeQuest?

LifeQuest is a gamified habit tracker. Yup simple enough right, BUT WAIT theres more. This app which I will continue to pour my soul into, allows you to visually see the progress you have made on any skill you wish to add to you personal collection. Coded every day for the last month, but you feel like you aren't any better? Well you'll see how impressive it is when the numbers start STACKING! Keep at it and 1 skill point a day you'll reach those goals.

# Why You Ask?

I am a firm believer of the Kaizen philosophy, for those of you unaware it simply means Continuous Improvement. So if everyday you get 1% better at anything, you will eventually become a master. I wanted to create something that embodies the Kaizen philosophy and helps people achieve their best self by visually their progress even if its 1% each day. You can go to the gym for a month and those gains may not be visible yet, but LifeQuest will let you see those 30 days of STRENGTH stats rising as you continue to pump iron.

# Future

This is the first iteration of LifeQuest, but I want it to be much more.
here are some feature I plan to add:

- Leaderboard/Friends
  - I want friends to motivate each other to push forward everyday
  - Seeing others progress may be the push you need to make sure you complete today's quests
- Market/Inventory System
  - I want to add loot and gold to the app to further enhance the user experience
- Party Questing
  - I Definitely plan to create a party mode that allows user to complete quest together by completing their own quest, kinda like a way to hold each other accountable BUT FUN!
