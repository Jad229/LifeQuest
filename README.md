# LifeQuest: Forge Your Best Self

### Gamified Habit Tracker

# What is LifeQuest?

LifeQuest isn't just your average habit tracker – it's a journey to your best self, gamified for maximum motivation. Dive into a world where your daily progress becomes a visual spectacle. Ever coded diligently for a month and wondered, "Am I really getting better?" LifeQuest shows you the impressive stack of achievements, one skill point at a time.

# The Kaizen Spirit

Embodying the philosophy of Kaizen—Continuous Improvement—I've poured my heart into creating an app that celebrates every small step towards mastery. Imagine becoming 1% better each day; LifeQuest turns that philosophy into a tangible reality. Whether you're hitting the gym, coding, cooking, reading or mastering a skill, watch your progress visually unfold, day by day.

# Why LifeQuest?

I believe in the power of progress, no matter how small. LifeQuest is your daily companion, revealing the growth that might go unnoticed in the mirror or the code editor. Those 30 days of pumping iron? LifeQuest showcases your rising STRENGTH stats as you keep pushing boundaries.

Your quest for a better self begins now. Let's Level Up, One Day at a Time!
